  ## Description
 A web app that uses GitHub's API to search for open source projects with open issues and pull requests. Consider a website like Facebook or Twitter, where new posts, pictures, and comments load into view as the user scrolls down the page. To retrieve that data as needed, these websites make requests to their own servers via server-side APIs. Some companies make their server-side APIs public; other websites can then use those public APIs to make the same requests and load third-party data into their own apps. This project mainly uses GitHub API for fetching repos and issue ralated.
